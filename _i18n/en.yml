    title: Crude Oil
    subtitle: Interesting facts about crude oil
    slides:
       - Germany covers about 2% of its crude oil demand with domestic production.
       - The Mittelplate/Dieksand oilfield in the Wadden Sea contains some 25 million tons, which amounts to roughly one third of the extractable German crude oil deposits.
       - Crude oil and natural gas are created by deposits of large amounts of micro-organisms, mainly algae.
       - On average, crude oil deposits are found at a depth of around 1.5 km. Technical progress, however, has made it possible to open up oilfields at a depth of 5000 meters (m) and more.
       - More than 22,000 drilling operations have been carried out since crude oil and natural gas production began in Germany.
    geschichte:
      title: History
      p: Crude oil has been industrially extracted in Germany for more than 150 years. The successful oil well in Wietze near Celle in 1858/59 is generally recognised as being one of the first in the world. Crude oil production in Germany peaked in 1968 with an annual production of around 8 million tons. Annual production in 2015 amounted to 2.4 million tons. Proven and potential crude oil reserves in Germany are estimated to be around 34 million tons as of 01.01.2016.
    wirtschaftliche-bedeutung:
      title: Economic importance
      p: "In 2017, current domestic oil production amounted to around 2% of Germany’s annual consumption. The value of the extracted petroleum is about €860 million for 2015; in terms of economic importance, this is the third most important source of fossil fuels in Germany, behind natural gas and brown coal. In a 2017 international comparison of crude oil-producing countries, Germany was in 56th place (1970: 26th place). At the end of 2017, 8,385 persons were employed in oil and gas production in Germany"

      title: Extraction
      p1: In 2017, as in the previous year, 50 oil fields were in production in Germany. These fields extract oil by means of some 1,000 production wells in drilling installations (onshore) and production platforms (off¬shore). In 2017, the oilfields of Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony yielded almost 91% of the total German production. The remaining production was mainly produced in the Rhineland-Palatinate as well as Bavaria, together with very low production levels in Hamburg, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The largest German crude oil field is the Mittelplate/Dieksand in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea (Wattenmeer) National Park. It has been developed since 1987 by a drilling and production island and by oil well facilities on the mainland. This oilfield accounted for more than half of Germany’s total crude oil production in 2017.
      p2: Crude oil is a fossil energy source. It is primarily used as a fuel for vehicular transportation and to heat buildings. Crude oil is also used in the chemical industry for e.g. the manufacture of plastics.

    subtitle: Interesting facts about natural gas
    slides:
      - In contrast to coal and oil, natural gas has only been used as an energy source relatively recently.
      - Germany has an active offshore gas field in the German Bight.
      - Natural gas is extracted on this one-hectare operating facility and supplied to some 15,000 households.
      - Natural gas has been extracted from gas fields in Germany for the past 100 years.
      - 8% of the demand for natural gas in Germany is covered by domestic production.
      - 95% of the natural gas is extracted in Lower Saxony.

    geschichte:
      title: History
      p: "In 1910, natural gas was found in Neuengamme (which is a district of Hamburg today) when drilling for water. The industrial production of natural gas started in 1913. However, natural gas production in Germany remained minimal until the end of the 1960s, with only a 1% share of the primary energy consumption in Germany (West). The oil crises of the 1970s focused increased attention on the consumpti¬on of energy and the need for the development of energy sources. Domestic production grew with the discovery of large gas deposits on the German-Dutch border and the increasing conversion of town and coke-oven gas to natural gas. This was accompanied by a steady expansion of the gas infrastructure (from 12 to 20 billion m³(Vn) of raw gas between 1970 and 2005). In 2005, domestic natural gas production co¬vered up to 25% of German natural gas consumption. Since then, however, production has declined. In 2017, it amounted to around 7.9 billion m³(Vn) of raw gas, covering only about 7% of domestic natural gas consumption. The safe and probable reserves of natu¬ral gas are also declining. These levels amounted to around 63 billion m³(Vn) at the end of 2017. This means that the static range of the German natural gas reserves totalled 8 years. The decline in natural gas reserves and production is mainly due to the increa¬sing depletion of the large deposits and the resulting natural decline in extraction. There have been no sig¬nificant new discoveries in recent years. A legislative process lasting several years was also responsible for the decline in reserves; during this process, the topics discussed included future requirements for the use of fracking technology, which led to new legislation in 2016."

      title: Economic importance
      p: "Germany ranked number 46 in the comparison of all natural gas-producing countries in 2017. The country’s share of global gas production amounted to approx. 0.2% in 2017. Natural gas is of relatively significant economic importance in relation to other extracted natural resources such as lignite. The value of the na¬tural gas extracted in 2017 amounted to an estimated €1.43 billion. Natural gas accounted for around 12% of the total value of natural resources produced in Germany in 2017. At the end of 2017, 3,384 persons were employed in oil and gas production in Germany."

      title: Extraction
      p: "95% of German natural gas was extracted in Lower Saxony in 2017. Other federal states (Saxony-Anhalt, Schleswig-Holstein, Thuringia and Bavaria) contributed only marginally to the total production. 449 production wells extracted the natural gas on 77 gas fields. The A6/B4 gas field in the ‘Entenschnabel’ (duckbill) – an economic zone in the German Bight (North Sea) – is the only German offshore gas field. Like crude oil, natural gas occurs in underground deposits. Similar to the exploration of crude oil, the exploration of natural gas takes place primarily through seismic surveys and exploration drilling. Gas extraction takes place through a borehole stabilised with cement and steel and a riser pipe is then inserted through the hole."

      title: Uses
      p: "As a fossil energy source, natural gas is mainly used to heat residential and commercial premises, to supply heat for thermal processes in trade and industry (e.g. in large bakeries, brick factories, cement factories, foundries and smelters) and to generate electrical power; it is used as fuel for ships and motor vehicles. Natural gas also has many other significant uses – as a reactant in chemical processes (e.g. for ammonia synthesis in the Haber-Bosch process (nitrogen fertiliser)), for iron ore reduction in the blast furnace process and in the production of hydrogen."

      - The subsidized coal mining industry in Germany will end by December 31, 2018, with the closure of the last remaining mines in Bottrop and Ibbenbüren.
      - The termination will be carried out in a socially acceptable manner and on a legal basis.
      - With approx. 6 million tons extracted in 2015, German hard coal covers around 10% of the German requirements.
      - Around 90% of the hard coal is imported, mainly from Russia, Colombia, the USA and Australia.
      - In an international comparison, German hard coal mining is characterised by difficult geological conditions (extreme mining depths, thin seams, overburden pressure) and an extensive, subterranean infrastructure.
    geschichte:
      title: History
      p1: "The hard coal industry in Germany gained in economic importance during the industrial revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries. Production increased steadily, reaching an annual peak of more than 200 million t at the beginning of the Second World War. After WW2, German hard coal was used in the electricity, steel and heat supply industries. In the mid-1950s, 600,000 employees in 170 mines extracted 150 million tons of hard coal every year. In the late 1950s, however, this situation changed – German hard coal could no longer compete efficiently in the world market since its extraction is carried out exclusively through underground mining. Even today it still needs subsidies from public authorities. Imported coal and – above all – cheaper crude oil replaced the German hard coal."
      p2: "The current situation in which the German hard coal mining industry finds itself is the result of a continuous adaptation process, one which started with the founding of the Ruhrkohle AG (RAG) – a merger of 51 Ruhr area mines – in 1969."
    ausblick:
      title: Outlook
      p1: On February 7, 2007, the German Federal Government, the states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland, the RAG AG and the Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial Union (IG BCE) agreed to end the subsidised production of hard coal in Germany at the end of 2018 in a socially-acceptable manner. The phase-out process is governed by the ‘socially acceptable phasing-out of subsidised hard coal mining in Germany’ framework agreement of August 14, 2007 and by the German Hard Coal Financing Act, which came into force in December 2007.

      title: Economic importance
      p1: In 2015, hard coal accounted for 12.7% of primary energy consumption in Germany and contributed 18.1% to German electricity production. In the same year, power stations accounted for 78% of the total consumption of hard coal, the steel industry and other producing industries accounted for 20% and the domestic heating sector and small consumers accounted for some 2%. 6.2 million tons of German hard coal were extracted in 2015. This is equivalent to a value of some €557 million. 8,500 hard coal industry personnel are currently employed in Germany’s only two remaining hard coal mines, one in Bottrop and the other in Ibbenbüren. In view of this development, imports today cover around 90% of the demand for hard coal and hard coal products (57.5 million tons in 2015).

    slides_title: Interesting facts about Lignite
    slides:
      - With production at around 178 million tons in 2015, lignite accounts for almost 12% of primary energy production in Germany.
      - Lignite accounts for around 24% of gross electricity generation.
      - Lignite is currently mined in 10 active open-cast mining sites on 3 lignite coalfields. The Rhineland is the largest brown coal region in Europe and Germany is the world’s largest producer of lignite.
      - Germany covers 100% of its lignite requirements from its domestic reserves.
      - Recultivation and compensation for land required for mining are important issues for the German lignite mining industry.
    geschichte:
      title: History
      p: As early as the 17th century in Germany, lignite was being produced as a replacement fuel for wood, which was becoming increasingly scarce. With increasing industrialisation and the development of new deposits, the 19th century saw an increase in lignite production from 170,000 tons in 1840 to 40 million tons in 1900. This trend continued unabated in the 20th century until production reached an all-time peak in 1985 with 433 million tons produced that year. Much of this increase in overall German lignite production was attributable to the East German lignite coalfields. After the East/West German reunification, lignite production in East German lignite coalfields declined by 67% between 1989 and 1994, caused mainly by a change in the fuel mix. Total German production fell from 410 million tons to 207 million tons during this period.
    gewinnung:
      title: Extraction
      p: Lignite is mainly extracted in three areas – the Rhenish, Lausitz and Central German regions, where mining is only carried out in opencast mines close to the sur¬face. Annual production in 2017 amounted to appro¬ximately 171.3 million tonnes and has largely remai¬ned constant in recent years. The value of the brown coal (lignite) subsidised in Germany in 2017 amounted to €2.3 billion. This means that lignite is the most important natural resource in Germany, in terms of the value of production. With the decline in lignite production in the wake of German reunification, the number of persons directly employed in lignite mining fell from 130,000 in 1990 to 20,891 in 2017.
    verwendung:
      title: Uses
      p: Around 90% of the lignite Germany produces is used to generate electricity and district heating. The economic advantages in using lignite result from the combination of the opencast mine and power plant being near the location of the lignite deposits. Around 10% of the lignite produced is refined into solid or pulverised fuels for commercial use and private households (e.g. brown coal briquettes, pulverised lignite, fluidised bed lignite and lignite coke). In 2017, lignite accounted for 11.1% of the primary energy consumption and contributed to 22.5% of electricity generation. The domestic production of lignite covers the country’s annual consumption.

    - Salt has been actively extracted by humans for over 5,000 years.
    - The importance of salt for many cities is often reflected in their names. 
    - If saline sources were discovered in a town, the syllable ‘Bad’ (spa) was added to the town’s name – this ushered in the birth of today’s spas.
    - In the mid-19th century, Justus von Liebig discovered the importance of potassium as an essential plant nutrient.
    - When miners coincidentally discovered the world’s first known potash deposit while searching for rock salt near Staßfurt in 1856, the first potash mines and works were subsequently established in Germany around 1860.
    - In the high-medieval period, the brine pipeline from the Reichenhall mine to Traunstein was one of the first pipelines for natural resources in the world.
    - The Werra potash mine is the largest underground mining area in Germany.

    p2: Germany has large salt deposits, which are mainly concentrated in northern Germany. Over millions of years, deposits of salts resulted in several 100m-thick layers. Bavarian and Austrian Alps salt is of a similar age and has been extracted for thousands of years.
    p3: The commissioning of the first potash plant in the world in Staßfurt in 1861 founded the almost 150-year tradition of German potash mining. The extraction of salt by solubilisation, i. e. by making it soluble using water injected via boreholes, or by mining in salt mines, has a long history. People were digging for salt in the Berchtesgaden area as early as the 12th century. In the 16th century a salt mine was built there which is still in operation today.

    p1_1: In 2017, the amount produced in Germany was ap¬proximately 14.6 million tonnes of rock salt (including industrial brine) and some 6.7 million tonnes of potash and potash salt products. With a total production of approx. 5%, Germany was the fourth largest producer of salt in the world in 2017, after China, the USA and India, and also the fifth largest potash producer with around 7% of the world’s total production. In 2017, a total of 8,260 persons were directly emplo¬yed in potash mining in Germany and a further 2,434 in salt mining.

    title: Extraction
    p: Extraction takes place in Germany in six potash mines (in Hesse, Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia), seven salt mines (in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia) and seven salt works (in Baden- Wuerttemberg, Bavaria, Mecklenburg-Western-Pomerania, Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia). Salt mining is carried out in the mines by means of drilling, blasting or cutting techniques or by bringing out underground deposits. Brining out is done by introducing freshwater or half-brine into the salt deposits through borehole probes, after which the salts dissolve. The brine is then pumped through a probe and processed above ground in salt works, where it eventually becomes salt (and other by-products).
  verwendung:
    title: Uses
    p1: Rock salt and evaporated salt is used as commercial and industrial salt – we also use it on our food and for de-icing purposes. Salt is an indispensable natural resource for the chemical industry, e.g. in the production of soda, chlorine and caustic soda. Glass, plastic and aluminium could not be produced without salt.
    p2: It is used as regenerating salt in water softening plants, in the feed industry, in road services, for snow clearing and in the food industry. Sodium chloride meets particularly high purity requirements as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. The potash crude salts extracted by mining are mainly used in agriculture as fertilisers. However, they are also used as industrial salts in electrolysis and other industrial processes – and there is a demand for these salts in highly-purified form for the food and feed industries and for pharmaceutical purposes.

  p1: Quarried natural resources comprise a great number of mineral deposits, in particular gravel and sands, broken natural stone, lime, marl and dolomite stones and gypsum and anhydrite stones, as well as clays and loams. Quarried natural resources are bulk raw materials; due to geological conditions, they are site-bound and not distributed evenly across the country.

  slides:
    - Every year, the building materials and quarrying industry extracts roughly 550 million tons of primary raw materials or uses these materials in production. In addition, almost 100 million tons of secondary raw materials are used every year in the production of building materials to conserve resources.
    - Quarried natural resources include a variety of mineral deposits; gravel, sand and natural stone account for the largest proportion of the extracted materials in terms of volume.
    - Around 80% of the quarried natural resources is supplied to the building industry and around 20% is used in the chemical, steel or glass industries.
    - Quarried natural resources are needed for the manufacture of many products that we use in our daily lives. Stone powder, for example, is the basic ingredient of toothpaste.
    - Statistically, each one of us needs 1 kg of plaster, stone dust, sand, gravel or natural stones per hour.
  geschichte:
    title: History
    p: Quarrying has been handed down since the beginning of human history. According to scientific findings, the oldest known ‘stones from human hands’, found in ground fortifications in the Near East date back to between the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. Germany also has a very long quarrying tradition. In the past, these raw materials were mainly extracted by hand, but companies today use modern technology. Geophysics, GPS, intelligent machine and plant control and largely automated processes control the extraction of these natural resources.

    p: Every year, the building materials and quarrying industry extracts roughly 550 million tons of primary raw materials or uses these materials in production. In 2017, gravel and sands, with around 257 million tonnes, and broken natural stone with some 220 mil¬lion tonnes were among the most important raw ma¬terials in the German extractive industry. The building materials and quarrying industry (earth and stone) in Germany comprises some 1,600 companies operating approximately 3,100 extraction facilities.

    p: Around 80% of the earth and stone is supplied to the building industry and around 20% is used in the chemical, steel or glass industries. In addition to the extracted primary earth and stone, almost 100 million tons of secondary raw materials (mineral construction waste and by-products from industrial processes) are used in the building industry every year. These result from e.g. the demolition of buildings, the production of pig iron (blast furnace slag) or from electricity generation in conventional power stations (FGD gypsum, fly ash). The use of secondary raw materials contributes to the substitution of primary natural sources. The substitution rate is around 15%.

      title: History
      p1: Industrial minerals are mineral rocks that can be im¬mediately used in industry due to their special chemi¬cal and physical properties, i.e. without any substance conversion. In addition to the salts already mentioned, this group includes kaolin (also called china clay or porcelain earth), quartz sand, quartzite, feldspar, sticky sand, bentonite, special clay, silicas, fluorite and barite.
      p2: Industrial minerals have been extracted in Germany for hundreds of years in very diverse quantities. Apart from salts, the two most important industrial minerals in Germany in terms of volume are quartz sand/ gravel and special clay with production volumes of around 10.3 million tonnes and about 6 million tonnes respectively in 2017.
    gewinnung:
      title: Extraction
      p1: The extraction of industrial minerals in Germany is extremely regional in structure, due to natural conditions. While, for example, kaolin and silica are mainly extracted in Bavaria, the extraction of special clay is mainly concentrated in Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse.
      p2: Apart from salts, industrial minerals in Germany are mainly mined above ground by small and medium-sized enterprises. In contrast, fluorite and barite are also mined underground. In 2014, Germany boasted a total of 627 active production sites, around half of which were dedicated solely to the extraction of quartz and quartz sands.

      title: Uses
      p: Due to their chemical and physical properties, industrial minerals are used primarily in the paper, chemical, glass, ceramics, refractory, and foundry and steel industries; but the pharmaceutical industry, environmental management (waste gas purification, wastewater treatment plants, solar panels and wind power plants) and the automotive industry also exploit the properties of industrial minerals.

    title: Outlook Gypsum
    p1: "The expansion of renewable energies in the course of the energy transition is linked to the reduction and future phase-out of coal-fired power generation. This has major implications for the gypsum industry, which largely manufactures its products on the basis of FGD gypsum from coal-fired power plants. FGD gypsum is produced as a by-product in the flue gas desulphurisation plants (FGD) of coal-fired power stations or power stations that are operated with fossil fuels."
    p2: "Due to the reduction or phase-out of coal-fired power generation, the demand for gypsum must therefore in future be covered by other means, for example by the extraction of natural gypsum or by gypsum recycling."

rechtlicher-rahmen:
  title: Who is responsible? Laws and the responsibilities of public authorities
  p: "The extraction of raw materials is regulated in Germany by the BBergG (German Federal Mining Act, hereinafter BBergG). In 1982, it replaced the old mining laws of the Federal States and the numerous ancillary mining laws of the Federal and state governments. The overall control of the mining law within the Federal Government is the responsibility of the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy. The mining authorities of the Federal States implement the BBergG and also bear the responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of mining activities (depending on the natural resources in question). The Federal States have passed some of their own mining regulations in order to meet the specific requirements and characteristics of their own regions."

  p1: "Mining rights constitute the basis for the exploration and extraction of free-to-mine natural resources. Applications are made in the form of a permit, a license or proprietary mining rights."
  p2: "There are three different types of mining rights:"

  erlaubnis:
    title: "Permit"
    p1: "The permit is a mining right which grants the right to carry out explorations for free-to-mine natural resources on a specific, permitted minesite. The permit is time-limited to a maximum of 5 years and may be extended for a further three years (see § 16(4) BBergG). A legal entitlement to the granting of a permit exists, unless there are grounds for refusal."
    p2: "The permit may be refused if, for example, no work programme exists or the fixed time period is not taken into account in the planning. The grounds for refusal are fully itemised in § 11 BBergG. If explorations have not started within one year, for reasons for which the permit holder is responsible, the permit will be revoked (§ 18 BBergG)."

  bewilligung:
    title: "Licence"
    p1: "The licence is a mining right which grants the right to carry out exploration operations for free-to-mine natural resources on a specific, licensed minesite. The licence defines ‘a reasonable period of time for the implementation of extraction in individual cases’. ‘Fifty years may only be exceeded if this is necessary in view of the investment normally required for the extraction’. A time extension is possible (see § 16(5) BBergG). A legal entitlement to the granting of a license exists, unless there are grounds for refusal."
    p2: "The licence may be refused if, for example, it cannot be proven that the resources can be extracted, due to their location and nature (see § 12 BBergG). If extraction work has not started within three years, as a rule, the licence must be revoked (§ 18 BBergG). The grounds for refusal are fully itemised in § 12 BBergG."

  bergwerkseigentum:
    title: "Proprietary mining rights"
    p1: "Mining may be carried out under these rights. They include the licence with the possibility of eligibility as collateral with the relevant easements and mortgages. The licence expires when proprietary mining rights become valid. The proprietary mining rights details are entered in the Land Register, viz., the name and address of the applicant and details of the minesite. Proprietary mining rights define ‘a reasonable period of time for the implementation of extraction in individual cases’. ‘Fifty years may only be exceeded if this is necessary in view of the investment normally required for the extraction’. A time extension is possible (see § 16(5) BBergG). If regular extraction of the natural resources is interrupted for more than 10 years, as a rule, the proprietary mining rights must be revoked (see § 18 BBergG). To apply for proprietary mining rights, the applicant must already be in possession of a licence for the minesite in question. Proprietary mining rights may also be refused if, for example, evidence cannot be furnished that an economic extraction of the natural resources is to be expected (see § 13 BBergG)."
    p2: "In compliance with §75 of the BBergG, mining authorisations and mining maps are created to document the mining rights. Information about licences, permits, proprietary mining rights and on the minesites in question is available in these documents."

  sonderfall1:
    title: "Special case: Mining rights under the old laws"
    p: "The various forms of mining rights described above (permit, licence and proprietary mining rights) are also supplemented by older legal mining rights, which are described as old rights. These are mining rights that were granted before the current Federal Mining Act of 1982 came into force, e.g. for the lignite opencast mines in the Rhenish mining region. Under current law, these rights are still valid (see § 149(1), sentence 1 BBergG) if they were shown to the relevant mining authority during a phase-out period of three years after the Mining Law of 1982 came into force and if they were confirmed by mining inspection authorities. In contrast to mining rights under the new BBergG, rights under the old laws are not time-limited and neither extraction nor minesite royalties have to be paid. In practice, these old rights mainly apply to hard coal and lignite. An operating plan must be approved before these natural resources can be extracted."

  sonderfall2:
    title: "Special case: Unique features in the ‘new’ German Federal States"
    p: "The mining rights system of the GDR only applied to the (communist) state-owned and other mineral resources. The state-owned natural resources mainly comprised free-to-mine and privately-owned resources and were the property of the communist state. Other natural resources primarily comprised landowners’ natural resources and were allocated to the land ownership category. The Bestowal Regulation of 15.08.1990 created the foundation for the conversion of mining rights for state-owned natural resources into free-to-mine resources, which were subsequently recognised by the legal system of the reunited Germany. The transferred mining rights are deemed to be proprietary mining rights. Like the mining rights under old law, the transferred rights are not time-restricted and are also exempt from minesite and extraction royalties (see § 149 and § 151 BBergG). In contrast to the Federal States of the former West Germany, the validity of the old rights (see section on mining rights under the old laws) in the ‘new’ Federal States does not only extend until 1980, but also applies to deposits explored up to and including 1990. These rights also apply to both free-to-mine and privately-owned natural resources. Exploration and extraction rights for privately-owned natural resources were also governed by GDR laws on state-awarded mining rights."

    title: Contracts
    p1: "In some countries, the conditions under which natural resources can be extracted are negotiated directly between the extractive companies and the government agencies and the results of these negotiations are set down in contracts between the parties involved. This is not usually the case in Germany, since the conditions for the exploration and extraction of natural resources are generally validated by law and implemented by the respective competent authorities."
    p2: "Against this (international) background, the EITI encourages participating countries to promote transparency with regard to these contracts in requirement 2.4 of the EITI standard. The EITI requirement thus requires an understanding of the content and scope of the ‘contracts’ and/or ‘agreements’ (between government agencies and extractive companies) in which ‘conditions’ relating to the extraction of natural resources are specified."
    p3: "In Germany, the extraction of both free-to-mine and privately-owned natural resources and landowners’ natural resources is subject to a procedural, public-law licensing regime, the content, process and scope of which differs according to the type of the natural resource involved and the size of the extraction operation. Relevant legislation can include regulations on mining law, Federal building law, water law, immission protection and nature conservation laws. The various legal requirements are specified and implemented for the respective mining project through official approvals. The ‘conditions’ within the meaning of EITI requirement 2.4, under which the extraction of natural resources takes place, are defined as part of the approval by the state. This approval procedure in Germany is based on relevant legal requirements, and as such it differs significantly from the private-law contracts practised in many other countries. These aspects must be accordingly considered in the future specification of the requirements of the EITI standard under 2.4."
    p4: "Competent authorities are already publishing approvals on their websites today, if the project in question requires an environmental impact assessment. In addition, transparency exists with respect to mining rights where the extraction of free-to-mine natural resources is concerned ("

    p5: "In addition, ‘agreements’ may also be of a private legal nature and may be concluded between extractive companies and government agencies. Further terms and/or conditions relating to the extraction of the resources may also be agreed between the contracting parties. In individual cases, contractual agreements regarding the confidentiality of the contract content may preclude any centrally-controlled recording and/or publication of these agreements. However, the provisions for the preparation of a payment report provide an obligation for companies extracting natural resources to disclose payments ‘in order to improve infrastructure’ in § 341r No. 3 of the HGB (German Commercial Code). According to the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Germany (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer in Deutschland e.V.), such payments include amongst others those for the promotion of municipal investments or educational institutions, which are, for example, set down in private legal agreements. In this respect, it is assumed that the publication of payment reports will also lead to a disclosure of cash flows from private legal agreements between the extractive industry and the State, but not to a disclosure of the contractual contents of such private agreements. To clarify the exact content-related substance behind this reason for payment, we must await the future analysis of published payment reports and the development of other pertinent legal and/or business issues."
    p6: "In Germany, the EITI requirement for the promotion of transparency with respect to contracts and agreements between government agencies and extractive companies is currently being addressed and discussed in the MSG."

Regardless of the activity involved, all companies in the natural resources sector – and most other companies – are subject to trade and corporation tax."

  zuständigkeit-für-die-einnahmen:
    title: Who is responsible for revenues collection?
    p: Due to the federal structure of the Federal Republic of Germany, tax administration is split between the Federal Government and the states. Depending on the type of tax, it is levied by the financial authorities of the Federal Government, the states or the local authorities. One exception to this rule is minesite and extraction royalties, which are levied by the mining authorities of the states.

      p: A company (which extracts natural resources) with the legal form of a limited company (in particular a limited liability company or public limited company) which has its head office or management in Germany is subject to unlimited corporation tax. Limited companies which do not have their head offices and management in Germany are subject to corporation tax on the income generated in Germany. In Germany, corporation tax amounts to 15 % of the taxable income. The revenue is shared by the Federal Government and the states. Corporation tax is levied by the tax authorities of the Federal States. Read the law

    feldes-und-förderabgaben:
      title: Minesite and extraction royalties
      p1: Companies and persons require a permit to prospect for ‘free-to-mine’ mineral resources (§ 7 BBergG (German Federal Mining Act)). Owners of this type of permit are required to pay an annual minesite royalty as per § 30 BBergG. Pursuant to § 30(3), first sentence, of the BBergG, this generally amounts to €5 per square kilometre of a minesite in the first year after the permit has been granted; the amount increases by €5 per year to a maximum of €25 per year, whereby the legislation of individual states may provide for differing royalty amounts and even exemptions under certain conditions (see § 32(2), BBergG and the
      link1: table of the first D-EITI- report on page 36 to 45
      p2: ). The expenses incurred for prospecting are set off against the minesite royalties. Minesite royalties must be paid to the state in which the licenced minesite is located.
      p3: If natural resources are found, a permit is required for their extraction. However, extraction is only possible if the necessary operating plan permit and any other permits such as water rights permits have already been granted. If the extracted natural resources can be used for financial gain, the permit holder must pay extraction royalties for the extracted free-to-mine natural resources as per § 31 BBergG. The standard rate for extraction royalties is 10% of the market value of the natural resources in question (§ 31(2), sentence 1, BBergG). Here too, individual states may stipulate different regulations in their legislation for the calculation of minesite and extraction royalties under certain conditions (see § 32 BBergG and
      link2: the table on page 36 to 45
      p4: ). Minesite and extraction royalties only apply to free-to-mine natural resources. While minesite royalties are appropriated into the respective state’s budget, the revenue from extraction royalties is used for inter-state financial equalisation. Minesite and extraction royalties are levied by the mining authorities of the Federal States.
    gewerbesteuer:
      title: Trade tax
      p1: Local authorities are responsible for the administration of trade tax, which is levied by the municipality in which the business is located. The purpose of the trade tax is to tax the objective earning potential of a commercial enterprise. However, unlike corporation tax, trade tax is not linked to economic performance. Additions and deductions correct the income of the commercial enterprise (§§ 8 and 9 GewStG [Trade Tax Act]). To calculate trade tax, the responsible tax office determines the taxable amount, which is 3.5% of the objective earning potential. The responsible municipality sets a uniform tax factor for all companies, which must be at least 200% (§ 16, (4), sentence 2, GewStG) and calculates the trade tax based on the taxable amount and the tax factor.
      p2: A company (which extracts natural resources) with the legal form of a partnership or limited company is subject to trade tax. If the operating facility is located in an area belonging to several municipalities or is operated in a number of municipalities, the assessment basis for trade tax is distributed among these individual municipalities (so-called ‘reallocation’). Salaries in the individual operating facilities are usually used a yardstick for reallocation, so each municipality concerned can collect its share of the trade tax paid by a natural resources extractive sector company.
      p3: An overview of the trade tax assessment rates (2017) of the municipalities in Germany is available via the
      link: Federal Office of Statistics.
      p4: Commercial taxation is the main source of tax for municipalities, followed by land tax. The municipalities must pay a portion of their tax revenue to the Federal and state governments as trade tax apportionments. The remainder of the trade tax for the municipalities flows into their general budgets, thus helping to finance the local infrastructure and to provide education and social services among other things.
    pachtzahlungen:
      title: Lease payments
      p1: In Germany, the extraction of natural resources is governed by the BBergG, if the resources concerned are free-to-mine or privately-owned natural resources. As per § 3(3), BBergG, free-to-mine natural resources include metals, salts and fossil fuels such as hydrocarbons, lignite and hard coal. The ownership of a property does not extend to free-to-mine natural resources, so in this respect the property rights of the landowner are limited. Privately-owned natural resources, however, are the property of the landowner, who may carry out prospecting and extract them if found, without the need for any additional special legal title in addition to the operating permit and other required public-law permits. Its inclusion in the scope of validity of the BBergG aims to make their extraction subject to a uniform legal framework throughout Germany and (in particular) to uniformly regulate natural resource extraction in underground mining and ensure uniformity in the management of mine inspection authorities.
      p2: In addition to privately-owned natural resources, there are the so-called ‘landowner’s natural resources’. These are bulk raw materials, such as gravel and sands, which are predominantly used as building materials and are extracted through opencast mining. Like the privately-owned natural resources, these are also the property of the landowner, but they are neither subject to mining law nor to mining inspection.
      p3: "A company does not have to own the land to extract privately-owned natural resources and landowners’ natural resources. If the owner of the land simply makes it available to the company on the basis of a legal private contract (e.g. through a lease agreement) – and this is often the case – that alone suffices. Such contractual arrangements may include fixed payments or payments that depend on the quantity extracted, or a combination of both variants. On the Federal state side, official bodies including local authorities (e.g. counties or municipalities) and forestry offices may have the roles of landowners and landlords. The revenues from the leaseholds are therefore transferred to municipal budgets or state budgets, thus making it possible to finance statutory tasks (et alia)."
    verbrauchsteuern:
      title: Excise duties
      p1: Energy and electricity taxes are particularly relevant for companies in the natural resources sector, within the framework of excise duties. Like the other excise duties, energy and electricity taxes are explicitly excluded from the reporting obligation within the framework of the legal commercial (corporation) payment report, as per the EU Accounting Directive and its implementation in § 341r no. 3 b of the HGB (German Commercial Code).
      p2: "The Energy and Electricity Tax Act is based on the harmonised provisions of the EU Energy Tax Directive (Council Directive 2003/96/EC of October 27, 2003, OJ EU No. L 283, p. 51). On April 1, 1999, the electricity tax was introduced in Germany within the framework of the law covering entry into the ecological tax reform, and the tax rates of the energy tax (at that time still called mineral oil tax) were gradually increased.  This created incentives to reduce energy consumption and to develop resource-conserving products and production processes."
      p3: The Electricity Tax Act and the Electricity Tax Implementing Ordinance constitute the legal basis for levying electricity tax. The Federal Government is entitled to electricity tax revenues, which amounted to €6.9 billion in 2017. The revenue from the electricity tax and the higher taxation of fuels and heating materials obtained in connection with the ecological tax reform contribute to keeping social insurance contributions at a manageable level. Administration and collection tasks are carried out by customs administration.
      p4: The electricity tax is levied for consumption, but it is usually levied as an indirect tax on the supplier and passed on to consumers via the electricity price for practical reasons – and this means that companies in the extractive sector must also pay electricity tax. The statutory tax rate is €20.50 per megawatt hour. Reduced tax rates can be considered for various purposes, e.g. railway electricity, whereas the production industry can particularly benefit from tax relief
      link3: "(read more on subsidies and tax relieves)."
      p5_1: The energy tax is an excise duty on energy products. It is governed by Federal legislation, and levied to tax the use of energy products as fuels or heating fuels within the German tax territory. The Energy Tax Act defines energy products as being (in particular), petrol, diesel fuel, light and heavy fuel oil, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, natural gas and coal as well as biodiesel, vegetable oil and energy products of a similar nature that are used as motor or heating fuels. The amount of the tax varies according to the energy product and its intended use and is regulated in the
      link1: Energy Tax Act.
      p5_2:  Tax concessions are standardised in the Energy Tax Act for certain energy products and intended uses
      link4: "(read more on subsidies and tax relieves)."
      p5_3:  Like the electricity tax, energy tax is levied by the customs administration, and the revenues flow to the Federal Government. In 2017, energy tax revenues amounted to approx. €41.0 billion. The revenue from energy and electricity taxes is the third-largest source of income for the Federal Government, after income tax and VAT.

  bedeutung:
    title: How important is tax secrecy in Germany?
    p1: Tax secrecy has a high priority in Germany. Since taxpayers must fully disclose their tax details to the financial authorities within the framework of their cooperation obligations, the privacy of their information must be ensured. This is ensured by the Tax Secrecy provisions (§§30 et seq.) of the German Tax Code (AO). The provisions of the Code regulate who must protect tax secrecy and under what conditions the disclosure or utilisation of data (which is subject to tax secrecy) is permitted. Tax secrecy thus serves to protect the taxpayer.
    p2: A breach of tax secrecy can only be permitted under very strict conditions. Any disclosure of information which is subject to tax secrecy is normally only permitted if expressly authorised by law, if the person concerned agrees to the disclosure, or if there is a compelling public interest in the tax data in question.
    p3: This is why the disclosure of data for voluntary reporting initiatives – like the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative – requires the explicit consent of the companies concerned. Similarly, the implementation of reconciliation regarding tax payments within the framework of the EITI process requires the permission of the taxpayer in the form of a power of attorney for the Independent Administrator to query the relevant tax data.

  gesetzliche-berichtspflicht:
    title: Statutory reporting obligation for extractive sector companies (BilRUG)
    p1: "The Accounting Directive Implementation Law (BilRUG) of July 23, 2015, implemented the requirements of the EU Accounting Directive 2013/34/EU of June 26, 2013 into German legislation. Many provisions of Sections 341q et seq. in the HGB correspond to the requirements of the EITI. All the ‘large’ limited companies and limited liability partnerships involved in the extractive sector or in the logging sector in primary forests are subject to these reporting requirements under commercial law (cf. § 341q, HGB). The term ‘large’ in the legal sense refers to companies that exceed at least two of the following three criteria on two successive reporting dates ((§ 267(3), HBG):"
    l1: Balance sheet total of €20 million.
    l2: Net turnover of €40 million.
    l3: An annual average of 250 employees.
    p2: Within the meaning of § 264d of the HGB, capital market-oriented limited companies, as well as credit institutions and insurance companies in the legal form of limited companies (including limited liability commercial partnerships) are also subject to the reporting obligation, irrespective of their size. Subsidiaries (in corporate group structures) that meet the size criteria and the criterion of activity in combination with their parent companies are also subject to reporting obligations. The size and location of the pertinent subsidiary is not relevant in this case.
    p3: The companies subject to the legal provisions are required to disclose all payments (specified in § 341r, No. 3 of the HGB) made to government agencies above a ‘materiality threshold’ of €100,000 per government agency, if these payments fall under one of the reasons for payment specified in § 341r, No. 3. In addition to tax payments, this includes e.g. licenses, concessions and other contractual relationships related to the extraction of natural resources. The data must be allocated to individual projects if more than one project was carried out in the year under review.

  gemeinsamkeiten:
    title: Similarities and differences in the reporting obligation as per EITI
    p1_1: In addition to the statutory reporting requirements pursuant to BilRUG, the most important financial flows of the extractive industry are also disclosed via the EITI (read more on
    link1:  payment reconciliation
    p1_2: ). The reporting requirements under commercial law largely correspond to those of the EITI. However, there are also differences.
    p2_1: One fundamental difference between the BilRUG and the EITI lies in the extent of the reporting. EITI stipulates that the participating companies from the natural resources extractive sector publish all significant payments they make to government agencies. In contrast to BilRUG, the material payments are not exhaustively listed by EITI and must be clarified in the course of the EITI process ((read more on
    link2: payment reconciliation
    p2_2: ). The EITI standard does not provide for a distinction between payments above or below the limit of at least €100,000 annually. The German D-EITI stakeholders have agreed to adopt the materiality threshold of the BilRUG.
    p3: In contrast to BilRUG, EITI relies on the mutual disclosure of the payment flows. The state must also therefore grant an insight into its income from the extractive industry, for the purposes of payment reconciliation. In this context, one of EITI’s main concerns is to make the payment flows available in the form of open data, thereby supporting the public debate.

  einnahmen_rohstoffsektor:
    title: How are the revenues of the extractive industry allocated?
    p1: The Federal state structure of the Federal Republic of Germany is reflected in the distribution of tax revenues. The level which has the authority for the revenues, i.e. how they are distributed between the Federal Government, the states and the municipalities is regulated by Article 106 of the Basic Law (GG), in which a distinction is made between so-called ‘community taxes’ and taxes which flow in their entirety to the municipalities, states or Federal Government. In the case of community taxes, the revenues are shared between the Federal Government and the states.
    p2: With regard to the extraction of natural resources, corporation tax and income tax are relevant examples of community taxes. The Federal Government and the states are each allocated 50 % of corporation tax revenues.
    p3: Trade tax, on the other hand, is purely a community tax, and as the most important source of income of the communities, it is allocated to the individual municipalities in which the relevant operating facilities/factories are situated. The Federal Government and the states’ share in the revenues of the trade tax through a specific allocation and redistribution mechanism.
    p4: With regard to the revenues from extraction royalties, redistribution between the Federal Government and the states also takes place. The revenues flow into inter-state financial equalisation. The Federal Government is entitled to the revenues from electricity and energy taxes.
    p5: As per § 3 of the Tax Code, the tax revenues from the extraction of natural resources are not earmarked for a specific purpose; the persons responsible for the Federal Budget, the state budgets and the municipal budgets decide how they will be used. The amount and use of revenues and expenditure are disclosed in detail every year. To this end, the Federal Government and the states adopt budget laws (the municipalities adopt budget statutes) that include their own budgets. When the budgets are published, all citizens then have free access to the information.
    p6_1: To facilitate public access to information on the use of tax revenues, the BMF publishes information about the Federal Budget on the

    title: Dealing with human intervention in nature
    p1: Every mining activity is associated with interventions in nature and landscape and can result in serious environmental impacts. At the same time, however, a contribution can be made to the conservation of biodiversity on former minesites and on certain areas of operating minesites. Compensatory actions, such as compensatory or substitution measures and compensatory payments are intended to compensate for interventions in nature and landscape and to restore their natural function.
    p2_1: It is estimated that around 1 % of Germany’s entire area will be necessary to ensure the country’s natural resources in the medium to long term. The area currently being mined amounts to 29 km², or 0.008 % of the total area of Germany (
    link1: Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources 2016, BGR
    p2_2: ). This corresponds to a daily area utilisation of an average of 8 ha. However, the areas used for the extraction of natural resources differ in their concentrations in the various regions, as a result of which the associated interventions in nature and landscape also evince great regional differences and concentrations.

    rechtlicher_rahmen:
      title: Legal framework
      p1: In the Federal Nature Conservation Act (BNatSchG), the general principle regarding interventions is that major interventions in nature and landscape are to be primarily avoided and minimised by the polluter. Unavoidable interventions are to be compensated by means of compensatory or substitution measures (hereinafter ‘compensatory measures’) or, if this is not possible, by a compensatory payment in monetary form (§ 13 BNatSchG). This general principle thus forms a processing cascade, which first provides for avoidance, then compensatory measures and, as a last resort, a compensatory payment. In the case of mining measures, this avoidance rule primarily targets a variant that is as environmentally-friendly as possible, since site alternatives due to the type of natural resource and technical considerations cannot be possible, and zero variances can be eliminated due to the economic priority of natural resources extraction. Unavoidable interventions in nature and landscape must therefore be offset or mitigated, particularly through the promotion of natural succession, renaturation, near-natural design, rehabilitation or recultivation (§ 1(5), P. 4f. BNatSchG).
      p2: Compensatory measures must be maintained and legally secured during the required period of time. The period of maintenance is determined by the approval authority in the certificate of approval. The perpetrator of the intervention (the polluter) or its legal successor is responsible for the execution, maintenance and safeguarding of the compensatory measures.
      p3: In accordance with German federal and European regulations, the possible effects of a project on particularly-protected species of animals and plants (special species protection legislation) and on the European protected area network NATURA 2000 must be examined in the approval procedures for nature conservation law interventions.
      p4: The BNatSchG contains a full regulation, viz. that the laws and norms of the Federal States on the instrumental design of the intervention regulation may not contradict it. In order to make the regulation more applicable, some Federal States have made supplementary regulations, whereby the practice differs from state to state, e.g. in the concrete assessment of the amount and the use of compensatory payments.

    zulassungspraxis_rohstoffförderung:
      title: Approval practices in the extraction of natural resources
      p1: If a company plans to intervene in nature and landscape by extracting natural resources, the nature conservation legislation on intervention regulation is dealt with at the level of the responsible approval authority. Depending on the respective type of natural resource, these are either the mining authorities of the German states (in the case of free-to-mine and privately-owned natural resources) or the state authorities in charge of the execution of the state-based excavation laws, the building and water resources management laws and the Federal Immission Control Act (in the case of so-called landowners’ natural resources). This procedure corresponds to the so-called ‘piggy-back’ procedure, which stipulates (in §17 BNatSchG) that the approval of all projects, which nevertheless require approval by an authority due to other legal provisions, will be carried out by the competent authority in conformity with the responsible nature conservation authority. The competent nature conservation authority must therefore be given a voice in the approval procedure, whereby the relevant approval authority is not bound by the recommendations of the nature conservation authority. However, the provisions of the specific species protection are compulsory and are not subject to consideration in this respect. Designations of protected areas must also be observed.
      p2: As part of the approval procedure, the entrepreneur shall also provide the competent authority with a Landscape Management Plan (LBP), which shall provide information on the location, nature, extent and timing of the intervention, as well as the intended avoidance and compensatory measures and, where required, the amount of the compensatory payment. In this case, the major part of the necessary compensation is to be regularly provided for renaturation or recultivation (see target definition BNatSchG). Compensatory measures on external surfaces are necessary if certain landscape or biotope structures cannot be restored or if specific measures are necessary for reasons of species protection.
      p3: In the case of the extraction of the so-called ‘free-to-mine’ (e.g. coal, salts, oil and natural gas) and privately-owned resources (e.g. stone, earths and industrial minerals) governed by the German Federal Mining Act (BBergG), the intervention regulation is processed as per the BNatSchG in accordance with the operating plan procedure under mining law, whereby the obligations as per the BNatSchG apply in full. Compensation for interventions can already take place within the scope of the obligation under mining law to rehabilitate the area (§ 55(1), No. 7 BBergG, § 1(5), P. 4, BNatSchG). If this is not possible, compensatory and/or substitution measures or subordinated compensatory payments pursuant to BNatSchG are necessary (see North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) example below). In the case of procedures which are subject to Federal Mining Act, the legal instruments of the Ordinance are applied, such as (and in particular) regular monitoring based on the main operating plans, which must generally be submitted and re-approved every two years.

    dokumentation_von_kompensationsmaßnahmen:
      title: Documentation of compensatory measures for interventions in nature
      p1: Since the amendment of the BNatschG in 2010, German Federal States are obliged to create compensation directories for all interventions in nature. However, these take various forms and are not publicly available in all Federal States.

      title: Example of the transparency of compensation directories in Baden-Wuerttemberg
      p1: The basis of the compensation directory in Baden-Wuerttemberg is formed by § 17(6) of the BNatSchG, the compensation directory regulation and the eco-account regulation of the state, which provide for the obligation to make documentation available for the public. The latter two regulations can be downloaded from the website of the Ministry of the Environment of Baden-Wuerttemberg. The Baden-Wuerttemberg compensation directory is divided into the ‘eco-account’ and the ‘intervention compensation’ sections.
      p2: An eco-account is an instrument for the perpetrators of interventions (polluters). It enables them to temporally and spatially decouple compensation measures from the mining area, making the measures more flexible to manage. Compensatory measures can be stockpiled via so-called ‘eco-points’, which are accumulated by means of the targeted ecological upgrading of external areas. The corresponding eco-points can be used for later interventions to compensate for the interventions either in whole or in part. Polluters such as natural resource companies and local authorities are involved here as producers, consumers and traders of eco-points.
      p3_1: A central overview of the total number of all interventions in Baden-Wuerttemberg, including their compensatory measures, is not available; however, the legal environmental protection eco-account measures and the compensatory measures already assigned to an intervention under nature conservation law can be accessed via the Internet sites of the responsible nature conservation sub-authorities at city and county levels (

    beispiel_für_festsetzung:
      title: Example of the assessment of compensatory payments in North-Rhine-Westphalia
      p1: In the case of an authorised intervention, compensatory money can be levied as an Ultima Ratio if negative impacts on nature are unavoidable, or if they cannot be compensated or replaced within a reasonable period. As per the BNatSchG, the compensatory payment is based on the average costs of the non-feasible compensation measures, including the necessary costs for their planning and maintenance, as well as the provision of the area, which encompasses personnel and other administrative costs. If these cannot be ascertained, the compensatory payment is based on the duration and severity of the intervention, taking into account the advantages accruing to the polluter (§ 15(6), P. 1 et seq., BNatSchG). The assessment of the amounts of compensatory payment is the exception rather than the rule in the approval of the activities of the natural resources extractive industry in North-Rhine-Westphalia. Nevertheless, there are cases in which, for example, the major part of the compensation takes place in recultivation, but a small computational, compensational deficit still must be implemented on an external area, or the assessment of the compensation through rehabilitation will not be appropriate. If the area in question or the required measure is unavailable, or can neither be implemented nor is expedient at a reasonable cost, a relevant compensatory payment is assessed. In North-Rhine-Westphalia, this assessment is made in accordance with the provisions of the State-level Nature Conservation Law (LNatSchG NRW) in consultation with the relevant higher authority for nature conservation (§ 33(1), LNatSchG NRW).
      p2: The beneficiary of the compensatory payment is the regionally-responsible, sub-authority for nature conservation, which must use the compensatory money for measures involving nature conservation and landscape management (§ 4a(4), LNatSchG NRW). If the compensatory payment is to be paid for an intervention in forested areas or to be used for the afforestation of land, the payment will be made available to the forestry administration (§ 31(4) LNatschG NRW).
      p3: Examples of the assessments of compensatory payments are the open-cast gravel mines in the open-cast mining zones in front of the lignite mining projects. In three of the open-cast mines, an ecologically-valuable rehabilitation was not indicated because open-cast lignite mining would use the area directly after the gravel or sand extraction operations.
      p4: In these cases, the local sub-authority for landscapes developed a simplified procedure by means of which an appropriate compensatory payment was assessed. A total of €265,767.90 in compensatory payments was assessed for the three projects mentioned above.
      p5: For another open-cast gravel mining project, a small-scale expansion was planned for which a compensatory payment was assessed, if the intended recultivation could not be implemented. The county sub-authority for nature conservation, however, would have to use the compensatory payment of €21,900 it received to implement another equivalent compensatory measure. (This list of examples is not exhaustive).
      p6: In the years between 2011 and 2015, a total of around €300,000 in compensatory payments were assessed for the North-Rhine Westphalia mining authorities. So far, there have been no compensatory payments for the lignite mining industry in North-Rhine Westphalia; intervention compensation is mainly carried out in the form of rehabilitation. The ratio of the many open-cast mining projects in NRW (especially lignite mining projects, some of which are on a very large scale) to the few small projects mentioned above shows that the assessment of compensatory payments plays a subordinate role in the procedures carried out under mining law.

    kooperation_zwischen:
      title: Cooperation between stakeholders
      p: Since each extraction of natural resources represents a significant intervention in nature and landscape, an environmentally-friendly extraction development and technology approach should be standard for companies in this sector. Timely renaturation and recultivation can contribute to the promotion of biological diversity; but operating extraction sites are also habitats for rare animals and plants. The cooperation between companies extracting natural resources, the persons working there and local conservationists has already proved its worth, because it enables the management of the extraction operations to be adapted to the local and specific biodiversity requirements. This usually succeeds if the company management and employees are continually involved in dialogue with specialist nature conservation institutions and persons. In the case of expansions or new extraction projects, an early dialogue between the stakeholders can also avoid conflicts before they arise. Information and training materials on the subject help to broaden the impact of initiatives like this, which are supported by strong memberships in the environmental and nature conservation associations, the mining, chemicals, energy and construction-agri-environment industrial trade unions, and economic associations at federal and state levels.

  rückstellungen:
    title: Provisions
    p1: In Germany, federal legislation stipulates that companies which extract natural resources must carry out recultivation measures. The companies are also obliged to create and maintain long-term accounting provisions (‘financing provisions’). These usually include measures which are still necessary after closure of the mine concerned, such as measures for the rehabilitation of the mine area and recultivation measures. Provisions are set aside for these financial obligations under accounting rules.
    p2: The amount of the provisions to be set aside is based on the anticipated expenses for various planned measures. Long-term tax provisions with a residual maturity of more than one year are also discounted, using a legally-defined interest rate and taking future cost increases into consideration. The expected dates of fulfilment are essentially dependent on the remaining economic useful life of the extraction sites in question. The obligations of some companies extend far beyond the year 2050.
    p3: Provisions for mining are shown on the liabilities side of the balance sheet in the annual financial statements of the extractive sector companies and this is why they are audited by professional auditors as balance sheet items. Provisions made must be in accordance with the relevant regulations; the tax authorities check any related fiscal issues.
    p4_1: Provisions made by companies which must publish their annual financial statements are shown transparently at
    link: http://www.bundesanzeiger.de
    p4_2: The duty of disclosure applies to all limited companies pursuant to § 325 of the HGB, all commercial partnerships without a natural person as a personally-liable shareholder (e.g. GmbH & Co. KG) and other companies that exceed a certain size.

  sicherheitsleistungen:
    title: Implementation securities
    p1: Implementation securities are an instrument provided in the Federal Republic of Germany to implement the renaturation, safeguarding and rehabilitation measures to be carried out by extractive sector companies. If a company should fail or refuse to carry out the above measures, the authorities ensure that no additional costs will have to paid by the general public by means of so-called ‘substitute performances’.
    p2: Implementation securities are expressly provided for under the Federal Mining Act (BBergG) as an official instrument for natural resources extraction projects which are subject to the BBergG. Individual Federal States have introduced similar legislation in their excavation laws (or other subordinate excavation regulations) for the extraction of natural resources which is outside the legal scope of the BBergG. Implementation securities can also be established to ensure the implementation of compensatory and substitution measures for interventions in nature and landscape, pursuant to § 17(5) of the Federal Nature Conservation Act (BNatSchG).
    p3: Within the scope of its discretion pursuant to § 56(2) BBergG, the mining authority may make the granting of operating plan permits dependent on an implementation security, if this is necessary to guarantee (in particular) the implementation of measures for risk prevention and rehabilitation in the areas affected by the extraction of the natural resources. This applies to follow-up measures of mining activities such as water drainage, for example, but also to the dismantling of equipment, the removal of water-endangering substances and the securing of former extraction sites by backfilling them or blocking them off completely.
    p4: In principle, the mining authority may permit any suitable form of implementation security if it considers that such a security is necessary and if there are no restrictions arising from the relevant statutory provisions; such forms of implementation security include the deposit of cash and bonds, mortgages, special default insurances, operational provisions, bank or group guarantees and so-called strict letters of comfort.
    p5: " Operating provisions, bank guarantees or insurance guarantees and, particularly in the case of large companies, corporate guarantees and letters of comfort are customary in the natural resources extractive sector. Cash and bonds are not usually accepted as securities, since the management of these is too complex for the authorities; implementation securities are therefore not payments from companies to state agencies."
    p6: The amount of the implementation security to be set is oriented on the estimated cost of a (possibly necessary) substitute performance. If a project is to be carried out in stages, the implementation security is set up in stages on the basis of the actual intervention and is approved on a pro rata basis after successful partial rehabilitation.

    verwendung_des_wasser:
      title: Use of water
      p1: During the initial development of a deposit of raw materials, the pumping out of ground water can lead to a lowering of the groundwater level. Water abstractions during extraction of the natural resources may also be necessary e.g. to keep shafts or excavation pits dry. This so-called drainage and mine water is treated, purified and then used as cooling water, provided to the public as drinking and industrial water, used as water for the protection and maintenance of moist biotopes, or introduced into surface water without being used further.
      p2: The use of water by the mining industry is associated with consequences for the water balance. Environmental impacts can result from, among other causes, the change in the groundwater level, the flow rate of water bodies and the introduction of drainage and mine water into surface waters.
    beispiel:
      title: "Example: Use of water in potash and rock salt mining"
      p1: "In potash and rock salt mining, water from different origins and of different quality levels including river water, groundwater and drinking water is used in many processes. Raw salt is generally mined by means of drilling and blasting in the underground mining of potash and rock salt. However, salt can also be obtained in a sol operation during which fresh water is introduced into soluble (salt) rock by means of a borehole, resulting in the creation of chambers filled with salt water. The salt-saturated water (so-called brine) is then conveyed to the surface via another pipeline. The salt is ultimately extracted when the brine evaporates."

The ECJ also expressly points out that in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(4) of this directive, the EU Member States are in any case empowered not to apply the cost-covering principle to certain water uses, while addressing the purposes and objectives of the directive."
      p1_2: Water abstractions must also be checked for compliance with the general environment targets of the WRRL. If the volume of ground or surface water abstracted exceeds certain thresholds, environmental impact assessments must be carried out for the projects concerned.
      p2: The implementation of the WRRL into national law took place in Germany through the Water Resources Act, which regulates the protection and use of surface and groundwater at national level. Water abstraction procedures are subject to the reservation on the granting of permission by the water authorities. The water laws of the Federal States supplement and concretise the federal water laws. They particularly determine the amount of water abstraction fees.

      title: Structuring of water abstraction fees
      p1: "The structuring of fees for water abstraction is carried out by the states that receive these fees. This is why water abstraction fees levied in Germany differ widely in 13 of the 16 states, the three exceptions being Hesse, Bavaria and Thuringia. The total revenue in the 2016 budgetary plans of the states was estimated at around €425 million. These revenues are partly used for water management tasks, or they flow into the general budget of the respective Federal State."

      p3: In most German states, levy rates differ according to the type of abstraction, volume, origin of the water (surface water or ground water) and the purpose for which the water is to be used. There are also various state-specific deviations from the relevant rules through exemptions or discounts, which may also apply to the natural resources sector.

    p1_1: "Very different rates are levied nationwide for the abstraction of water in the natural resources sector. For example, fees of between 0.3 and 5 €cents/litre for surface water are applied in some Federal States for certain types of mining operations (e.g. in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania), while in other states, the fees for groundwater abstraction apply ranging between 5 and 31 €cents/litre."

    p1_3: However, a publicly-accessible source of information on the amount of revenue from water abstraction fees paid by the natural resources sector does not exist.
    p2: Water abstraction fees represent a flow of cash between companies that extract natural resources and the German State. Due to the different levy rates (inter alia) in individual Federal States, the payments probably lie below the materiality threshold, which is why they are not included for payment reconciliation purposes in the first D-EITI report.

    title: Subsidies for the sales of hard coal
    p1: "The German hard coal industry is not competitive, mainly because of geologically-related high production costs. An agreement was therefore reached in 2007 between the Federal Government, the hard coal-producing states of North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland, the RAG AG (the largest German coal mining corporation based in the Ruhr region) and the Mining, Chemical and Energy Industrial Trade Union (IG BCE) that the subsidised hard coal industry would be terminated in socially-responsible manner by the year 2018. The agreement was based on the Hard Coal Mining Financing Law of December 12, 2007 and on a framework agreement between the Federal Government, the hard coal-producing Federal States, the RAG AG and the IG BCE. The public sector grants temporary aid to promote sales (balancing the difference between domestic production costs and the world market price) and to cope with the necessary decommissioning measures. The subsidies are gradually reduced and ultimately cycled out, a move that also addresses climate protection and resource conservation."

The subsidies pledged to the hard coal mining industry are being reduced over time. Between 1998 and 2005, Federal subsidies were cut by approximately 50% – and they were again reduced by 25% between 2006 and 2014. Deviations from the declining trend of subsidisation are based on the fluctuating world market prices for hard coal (inter alia)."

      p: "To cope with the necessary decommissioning activities, the private-law RAG Foundation is making the former investment assets of the RAG AG available to finance the remaining perpetual burdens following the closure of the mines (burdens such as mine water drainage, permanent land subsidence and groundwater purification). If these assets are not sufficient to cover the perpetual burdens, the Federal Government and the hard coal-producing Federal States will provide subsidies at a ratio of one-third to two-thirds respectively."

  anpassungsgeld_p: Employees who are at least 50 and 57 years old (underground workers and surface employees respectively) and who will lose their jobs before January 1, 2023 due to the closing-down of mines or rationalisation measures, will receive adaption payment as an interim benefit for a maximum of 5 years until their entitlement to pension insurance becomes valid. The adaption payment reflects the social responsibility of the Federal Government and the hard coal-producing Federal States. In 2016, the Federal Government guaranteed adaption payment totalling €113.2 million.

By the end of 2015 the number of employees had been reduced to 9,640 employees. The number of persons entitled to adaption payment is following this reduction trend, albeit with a time lag. Since more employees will be retiring after the last mine closures at the end of 2018 and a declining number of employees will still be needed after 2018 to complete the closure of mines, the current adaption payment guidelines will still apply until 2027.

    title: Concessions for electricity and energy taxes
    p1: There are various tax concessions for both the electricity and the energy taxes, including tax exemptions, tax reductions and tax relief.  The Electricity Taxation Act (StromStG) provides for certain types of use, or electricity generation. The Energy Taxation Act (EnergieStG) also covers uses in which energy products are tax-favoured. Some of these tax concessions are mandatory under the Energy Tax Directive.
    p2: As production industry companies, extractive sector enterprises can particularly profit from the different tax relief possibilities provided by energy and electricity tax legislation.
    p3: "Three regulations are particularly relevant here:"
    list:
      item1: "Tax relief for companies (§ 54 EnergieStG, § 9b StromStG): If a production industry company applies for electricity and energy tax concessions and its application is approved, it is granted a reduction of 25% of the tax rates on electricity, heating and the fuels used in its production facilities eligible for tax concession."
      item2: "Tax relief in the form of ‘peak compensation’ (§ 55 EnergieStG, § 10 StromStG): The additional burden of the ‘ecological tax reform’ on production industry companies is lightened by a reduction in their energy and electricity taxes. Since the increase in revenues generated by the ecological tax reform also served to reduce the factor of ‘work’ and contributed to companies paying less for employers’ contributions to pension insurance schemes in comparison to 1999, a comparative peak compensation calculation is carried out for companies in question. In order to avoid double relief for the employers’ pension insurance as well as for the energy used, saved pension contributions are taken into account in the calculation of the tax relief. The amount of relief is therefore calculated individually depending on the company, and is also capped at a maximum of 90% of the electricity tax paid and 90% of the tax share pursuant to § 55(3) of the EnergieStG. Prerequisites for claiming peak compensation are, among other things, evidence of a certified energy management system and an annual energy intensity reduction (by a statutory value) achieved by all the plants of the production industry company. The comparative value is the average energy intensity value for production industry companies between 2007 and 2012."
      item3: "Specific processes and procedures/Manufacturer’s Tax Law (§ 9a StromStG, § 51 EnergieStG, §§ 26, 37, 44 and 47 EnergieStG). Production industry companies can reduce their electricity and energy taxes by 100%, if the energy/electricity is used for precisely determined, energy-intensive purposes (such as electrolysis, metal production, production of glassware, etc.). In addition, companies that produce energy products on their own premises (refineries, gas extraction and coal mining companies) can use these self-produced energy products tax-free (or obtain tax relief) for the purposes of maintaining operations within their own companies."
    p4: "The subsidy report of the Federal Government contains the total subsidies for the entire production industry, whereas the subsidies in the natural resources industry are shown separately for each sector. The selected tax concessions shown in the table below apply to the entire production industry. Conclusions cannot necessarily be drawn about the proportion of the concessions for the natural resources production sector."

The Federal Government has set itself the goal of decarbonising the energy supply almost completely by 2050, thus reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, the combustion of fossil energies accounted for more than 80% of greenhouse gas emissions in Germany (752 Mt CO2 equivalents)."

  p2_2: " Fossil-fuelled power plants are currently needed (in addition to renewable energies) to meet energy requirements in Germany."
  p3: "The technologies of renewable energies require steel, cement or petrochemical raw materials as the following example shows: The components of a wind turbine consist of roughly 45% crude oil and petrochemical industry products. One wind turbine blade can be 30 to 50 metres long in large wind turbines and it contains up to 12,000 kg of petrochemical products."
  p4: "The political objective of the Federal Government not only has an impact on the German and European energy industry, but also on the German natural resources industry. Natural resources requirements are changing in Germany due to the energy transition – the demand for quarried resources, copper, steel, cobalt, lithium, rare earths, platinum group metals, indium and tellurium is increasing with the construction of renewable energy plants, storage facilities and intelligent networks. We will also experience displacement effects in the demand for natural resources: The change in the electricity production mix will influence the production of secondary raw materials. The decline in coal production, for example, affects the production of FGD gypsum. A decline in production would have to be compensated for by a corresponding increase in primary natural resource extraction (natural gypsum). This shows that a reliable supply of mineral and metallic raw materials and safe access to local deposits of natural resources are prerequisites for the success of the energy transition – and also for smooth-running production processes in the German natural resources industry."
  p5: "Some of the metals required for the energy transition (e.g. electronic elements such as indium, germanium and gallium) are additional raw materials, i.e. they are obtained as by-products during the extraction of a different metal. In the case of these metals, the regulatory mechanisms for the supply of natural resources only function to a limited extent. In Germany and Europe, potential deposits like this do exist, with the result that import dependencies could be reduced through the targeted development of these deposits and the extraction of their natural resources."
  p6: "In 2015, investments in renewable energies amounted to €15 billion, while the operation of the existing plants generated €14.7 billion in sales. The expansion of renewable energies can affect employment by increasing demand for the energies’ related goods and services. Wind power led the way – in 2015 the sector employed more than 140,000 people. The expansion of renewable energies is financed by feed-in tariffs which are higher than the stock exchange electricity price and this benefits renewable energy system operators. These feed-in tariffs are paid by the end users in the form of an additional charge on their electricity bills. If renewable energies are to expand further, industrial energy projects must be suitably combined with the development of the renewable energies. This also applies to the German natural resources industry, which has already established a series of wind, biomass, geothermal, solar and hydroelectric power projects in Germany."
  p7: "Renewable energy sources are used in electricity and heat generation and in the transport sector. The most important renewable energy source in the electricity sector is also wind power: In 2016, 40% of the renewable electricity was generated from wind energy. Wind energy plays a vital role in the expansion of renewable energies, an expansion which will ultimately result in an economically-viable and climate-friendly energy supply at reasonable prices and with a high level of general prosperity. The use of wind energy now accounts for more than 13 % of German electricity consumption. Wind turbines have been built on various closed minesites in North Rhine-Westphalia, mainly on now-green colliery slag heaps on which favourable wind conditions exist – and these man-made hills have a ‘model character’ in Germany. In addition to the further development of suitable land sites and the replacement of older, smaller wind turbines by modern and more powerful models – so-called ‘repowering’ – the expansion of wind energy at sea is also becoming increasingly important. In 2016 alone, wind energy turbines were installed with a capacity of around 4,500 MW on land and roughly 700 MW at sea. Wind turbines with a total capacity of around 47,000 MW are now operating in Germany; they produced almost 80,000 GWh of electricity in 2016, one sixth of which was generated by wind turbines at sea. The Federal Government is planning to have an offshore wind power of 15,000 MW on the grid by the year 2030. In view of this expansion and the ever-increasing power units (more than 10 MW per wind turbine), the need for mineral and metallic natural resources will also increase. Concrete, for example, is required for the construction of wind turbine foundations. This also means a correspondingly higher demand for limestone for cement production and for aggregates such as gravel and sand."
  p8: "Biomass has also become a very relevant energy source for electricity generation. The total capacity of biomass electricity generation plants is around 7,200 MW; electricity generation in 2016 amounted to more than 50,000 GWh (9 % of the total electricity consumption and 23 % of the renewable electricity generation). In addition to biogas (including biomethane and landfill and sewage gas), solid and liquid biomasses and biogenic waste are also used to generate electricity, but biogas is the most important single biogenic energy source for electricity generation with 63 % (2016) of the entire biomass."
  p9: "Solar energy can also be used to generate electricity. More than 1.5 million photovoltaic plants convert the sun’s radiation energy directly into electricity – these plants represented a total of around 40,000 MW of installed capacity in Germany at the end of 2016, and around 1,000 MW of power were added in that year. Electricity generation from photovoltaics continues to rise steadily as a result, attaining approximately 38,000 GWh in 2016. Photovoltaics thus accounted for 6.5 % of the total electricity consumption and contributed 20 % to the renewable energy supply. German mining companies are also increasingly opting for the use of photovoltaic systems at various mining sites in Germany."
  p10: "In addition to wind, biomass and photovoltaics, hydropower also contributed to electricity generation with around 22,000 GWh in 2016."
  p11: "Renewable energy sources are not only used by the electricity sector, they are also being used increasingly in the heating sector. In 2016, a total of 165,000 GWh was produced by renewable heat sources. The most important renewable energy sources for heat generation are biogenic solids with 111,000 GWh, produced mainly by wood in the form of e.g. wood pellets. Biogas, biogenic waste and geothermal energy and heat harnessed by heat pumps are also relevant renewable heat sources, each of which generated heat in excess of 10,000 GWh in 2016. As a base-load capable form of energy with a high annual production performance (the target for geothermal power plants target is > 8,000 h), deep geothermal energy is an integral part of a meaningful energy mix. Geothermal energy for heating is steadily growing in importance. Solar thermal energy also contributed to the supply of heat with around 7,000 GWh."
  p12: "In the transport sector, biomass can reduce CO2 emissions, especially in the form of biofuels such as bioethanol, biodiesel and biogas for cars, trucks, trains, ships and aircraft. Electric vehicles are another option for reducing CO2 emissions. In 2015, renewable energies accounted for 5.3 % of fuel consumption in Germany. "
  p13: "Thanks to its flexible use in the electricity, heating and transport sectors, biomass is the most important renewable energy source. In 2015, 60 % of the total final energy from renewable energy sources was provided by the various types of biomass used for energy purposes."
  p14: "The expansion of renewable energies helps to avoid greenhouse gas emissions and reduces the use of fossil energy sources which are mainly imported. Despite the expansion of renewable energies, conventional power plants are still needed. Since fossil fuels such as mineral oil, natural gas and hard coal are mostly imported in Germany, savings in this sector will also lead to a reduction in German energy imports: Renewable energies, as well as electricity generation based on Germany’s own energy raw materials can significantly reduce these import dependencies and thus increase energy security."

  steinkohle:
    title: Hard coal
    p: Plans are in the pipeline to end German hard coal extraction in a socially-acceptable manner by 2018, since the industry has been steadily declining for years. 6.2 million tons of usable output were extracted in 2015. An approximate value of €423 million for this quantity can be estimated from the average 2015 cross-border prices for power station coal.
  braunkohle:
    title: Lignite
    p: At 178.1 million tons, lignite extraction remained around the previous year’s level. According to the estimate of the BGR, this corresponds to a value of €2,431 million.
  erdöl:
    title: Crude oil
    p: German crude oil production in 2015 was 2.41 million tons. As in the case of hard coal, the BGR again used the average 2015 cross-border prices as a basis for estimating the value of crude oil production at €859 million.
  erdgas:
    title: Natural gas
    p: 2015 saw 9,387.62 m³ of natural gas (incl. petroleum gas) extracted from sites in nine German Federal States. As in the case of crude oil, the BGR again used the average 2015 cross-border prices as a basis for estimating the value of natural gas production at €2,064 million.
  kalisalz:
    title: Potash salt
    p1_1: "Two companies in Germany extract potash salt and magnesium salt. The usable extracted output in 2015 amounted to 5.7 million tons in the form of potash products ["
    link1: BMWi 2016
    p1_2: "]. 1.5 million tons from other by-products of potash production must be added to that figure ["
    link2: BMWi 2016
    p1_3: "]. The BGR calculated that the total quantity has a value of roughly €2,156 million."
  spezialton:
    title: Special clay
    p: According to the German mining authorities, 6.40 million usable tons of special clay were extracted in Germany in 2015. The clay in question is high-quality material for the ceramic industry and refractory use. According to the Federal Office of Statistics, the BGR calculated the value of this amount at €148 million.
  steinsalz:
    title: Rock salt and industrial brine
    p: 13.7 million tons of rock salt and industrial brine (NaCl content) were extracted in Germany in 2015, according to the German mining authorities. The BGR calculated the value of that quantity to be €566 million, based on value information from the Federal Office of Statistics.
  kaolin:
    title: China clay
    p1_1: "China clay or kaolin is used mainly in the paper industry and in the production of fine ceramics. According to information provided by the German mining authorities, 5.3 million tons of kaolin-bearing raw material were extracted in 2015, of which 3.8 million tons were usable ["
    link: BMWi 2016
    p1_2: "]. Around 1.1 million tons of saleable kaolin products remained after treatment and this quantity was valued at €119 million."
  quarzkies_und_sand:
    title: Quartz gravel and sand
    p1_1: In 2015, 9.7 million tons of quartz gravel and quartz sands
    sup2:
      title: "1"
      text: "In [BMWi 2016], a different classification is considered, namely that of quartz and quartz sand. Of these quartz sand and quartz gravel are only a sub-group, which is not specifically designated according to mining law. The data from [MIRO 2016] is therefore used to estimate the value."
    p1_2: "were extracted in 2015, valued at €205.5 million. Among its other uses, the raw material is used as vitreous sand, foundry sand and as a filler in chemical and building chemical products. "
  kies_und_sand:
    title: Gravel, sand and broken natural stone
    p: Around 95% of the gravel, sand and broken natural stone extracted today is used in the building and building materials industries [BGR 2016], where they are used in underground engineering and in the manufacture of concrete amongst others. In 2015, 239 million tons of gravels and sands (with a value of €1,510 million) and 210 million tons of broken natural stone (valued at €1,439 million) were extracted.
    sup1:
      title: "2"
      text: "All data taken from [MIRO 2016]. The amount of extracted gravels and gravel sands indicated in [BMWi 2016] is significantly less, since only very few of the companies are subject to mining law."
  naturwerkstein:
    title: Ashlar
    p: "Ashlar is first extracted in raw blocks and then sawn into plates of different formats, which are e.g. for facade cladding, wall and floor coverings, window sills, stair steps and gravestones. In 2015, 0.44 million tons of this natural resource were extracted, with an estimated value of €52 million."
  kalk_mergel:
    title: Limestone, marlstone and dolomite
    p: 48.9 million tons of limestone, marlstone and dolomite valued at €719 million were extracted in 2015. Limestone is used in many sectors, including home and road construction and in iron, steel, cement, glass and foodstuffs production.

    p1_1: "The natural resources sector generates revenue for the State at different Federal levels. The most important revenues are the taxes from general company taxation (corporation tax and income tax, as well as trade tax and the solidarity surcharge), as well as natural resource-specific minesite and extraction royalties. Added together, these revenues from the extractive industry amounted to around €555 million in 2017. This corresponds to a share of 0.04% of the total income of the Federal German government. The coverage of this revenue by payment reconciliation is explained in more detail "

      title: Taxes
      p1: The sum of the above-mentioned taxes paid by the extractive industry in 2017 amounted to €300 million. This corresponds to a proportion of around 0.02% of the State’s total income. The largest amount of tax revenues is generated by trade and corporation taxes. However, tax revenues from the extractive industry have considerably declined in recent years.
      p2: The following table shows the estimated revenues from the above taxes of the extractive industry and their share of the total tax revenue (for detailed source information

      körperschaftsteuer:
        title: Corporation tax
        p: "Statistical data from the years 2010 to 2012 was assessed. For the purposes of the assessment, the corporation tax amounts imposed on unlimited and limited corporation taxpayers before the deduction of capital gains tax or the like were taken into account. The update for the years 2013 to 2015 was made on the basis of the development of the gross value added of the economic sector B, ‘Mining and Quarrying.’"
      gewerbesteuer:
        title: Trade tax
        p1: "Trade tax in Germany is collected by more than 11,000 municipalities according to individually determined and thus differing rates. The basis for the calculation of the trade tax is trade income. This is the profit determined pursuant to the income tax law or the corporation tax law. The amount of trade tax may be increased or reduced by additions and reductions as per the German Trade Tax Act.  On the basis of the business income, a taxable amount is calculated uniformly throughout Germany and the trade tax to be paid by the company is determined by applying the respective tax factor of the municipality to the taxable amount. Trade tax is levied on corporations, partnerships and natural persons with their commercial income."
        p2: "Only the taxable amounts determined during the assessment procedure are included in the trade tax statistics. The Federal Office of Statistics used the results of a special evaluation of statistics for the years 2010 and 2011 to assign the positive taxable amounts of the companies in question to the relevant tax rates charged by the respective municipalities. This enabled the trade tax to be determined in an approximate manner."
      einkommensteuer:
        title: Income tax
        p1: "Natural persons, as individual entrepreneurs or members of a partnership, can also make profits in the natural resources extractive sector – and are therefore subject to trade and income tax. However, income tax statistics do not include any breakdown by economic sectors, therefore this statistic could not be used for the present study. The statistics on partnerships, however, are broken down into economic sectors, but they are only used to determine the earned income, which is subject either to corporation tax or income tax imposed on the parties involved (co-entrepreneurs)."
        p2: "Due to the above-mentioned problems, the income tax attributable to the natural resources extractive sector was estimated by means of the following procedures, using the trade tax statistics and the statistics on partnerships and communities:"
        p3: "An approximate profit was determined for the individual entrepreneurs, by means of retroactive calculation, using the positive taxable amounts assessed in the trade tax statistics for this group of persons. The sum of the income of partnerships, which, in the relevant industry, is attributable to natural persons as participants, was assessed from the statistics on partnerships and communities."
        p4: "An average tax rate of 28.6 % was applied to this profit or to this sum of earnings. This average tax rate was calculated using a microsimulation model for persons with commercial incomes who pay income tax. With the trade tax offset against the income tax, the results in the table show the approximate income tax amounts."
      solidaritätszuschlag:
        title: Solidarity surcharge
        p1: A solidarity surcharge is levied as a supplementary tax to income tax and corporation tax. It generally amounts to 5.5 % of the established corporation tax and income tax (see previous explanations).
        p2: Income tax and the solidarity surcharge are not part of the D-EITI payment reconciliation.

      title: Extraction and minesite royalties
      p1: Extraction royalties are levied by the mining authorities of the Federal States. They vary greatly, depending on the local mining activity and the fixed tax rates in the individual Federal States. A total of €255.9 million in extractive sector revenues was levied in Germany in 2017. The front runner was by far the state of Lower Saxony, with more than €181 million. Schleswig-Holstein was ranked second with around €62 million, followed by the Rhineland-Palatinate with around €4.6 million. In the case of some Federal States, the amount of revenue has been subject to significant fluctuations in the past few years. This may have different reasons, e.g. falling world market prices for raw materials or changes in production quantities.

    p: "Germany is characterised by a strongly export-oriented and diversified economic structure. In 2016, the country exported goods worth a total of €1,2 trillion. Products of the extractive industries accounted for some €6.6 billion of this amount, equivalent to 0.54 % of total exports. The crude oil and natural gas sectors accounted for the largest share of exports at almost €5 billion. However, this mainly involved re-exports of natural gas. Domestically-extracted natural gas is almost completely consumed in Germany. This sector is followed by ‘Quarried natural resources, other mining products’ with €1.3 billion. Exports also included ores (around €130 million) and coals (€125 million). Here too, the figures include re-exports, but to a much lesser extent compared to natural gas."

  li2: "All the companies identified and allocated to sub-section 07 (ore mining) do not actively engage in extractive mining in Germany and are therefore not considered."
  p6: "On the basis of the above-described selection process, a total of 48 companies and/or groups of companies were identified for possible participation in the D-EITI process and were requested to take part. Due to the difficult data situation, however, this number (48) cannot be described as being clear or conclusive."

On the other hand, quarried natural resources are extracted by a very high number of business operations with many extraction facilities and/or mines. One key reason for the purely regional production and marketing of these natural resources is the prohibitive cost of their transport. According to estimates by the German Building Materials Association – Quarried Natural Resources (BBS), the 25 largest quarried natural resources suppliers would account for only about 1.6% of the total number of companies in the industry and around 22% of the total number of the industry’s extraction sites.

    p1_1: "Corporation tax is the main income tax of limited companies in Germany; it is not a specific tax for extractive industry companies, but is levied on all limited companies that are domiciled in Germany or are active in the country. The assessment basis for corporation tax is the taxable commercial income, which is derived from the annual net profit; any tax modifications that may apply are also considered. If an enterprise is also active in other sectors as well as in the extractive sector, there may be delimitation problems regarding the share of corporation tax attributable to the activities in the extractive sector, since the corporation tax is calculated on the basis of the total taxable income ("

    title: "Particularities with regard to the recording of tax payments in certain parent-subsidiary constellations"
    p1: "Business partnerships such as the GmbH & Co. KG traditionally play a leading role in Germany’s small and medium-sized enterprises, in contrast to many other jurisdictions. They are subject to trade tax, but not to corporation tax. Corporation tax is first levied at shareholder level, but only if the shareholder is a limited company. In this respect, one special feature of the German tax law should be noted, according to which business partnerships are not themselves the subject of taxes in terms of income tax; the income generated by the company is subject to taxation at the level of the shareholders, together with the income they have earned from other sources."
    p2: "In the subsidiary-partnership constellation of a parent limited company, consequences may arise for the recording of the tax payments (trade tax and corporation tax) within the framework of data collection for the EITI report; examples of such consequences are shown below. In each case, it is assumed that a company has voluntarily participated in the data collection for the EITI report if it is active in the natural resources extractive industry."
    p3: "If both the parent limited company and the subsidiary business partnership are active in the natural resources extractive industry, all the relevant tax payments (trade tax of the subsidiary and the parent company as well as corporation tax at the parent company level) are recorded in the EITI report. If, on the other hand, the subsidiary or parent company is not active in the natural resources sector, either not all or too many tax payments to government agencies are recorded. If, for example, the parent limited company is active in the extractive industry, but the subsidiary-business partnership is not, the reported corporation tax payments of the parent company also include the financial results of the subsidiary. From the viewpoint of commercial law, it is possible (but not obligatory) to allocate corporate tax payments to activities both within the extractive sector and outside of it. If, on the other hand, the subsidiary-business partnership is active in the natural resources extractive industry, but the parent limited company is not, trade tax payments are only recorded for the subsidiary through the subsidiary’s (sole) participation in the data collection, but not, the corporation tax paid by the parent limited company (on a pro rata basis) for the financial results of the subsidiary. "
    p4: "This handling of corporation tax is due to the German tax system. The MSG has decided to pursue this legal, tax-related standpoint, also for EITI purposes."

  organschaftsverhältnissen:
    title: "Particularities with regard to recording the tax payments of consolidated tax groups"
    p1: "German tax law has specific special arrangements in the case of trade tax and corporation tax for corporate groups. Under certain conditions, a so-called ‘consolidated tax group’ may exist. In constellations like this, the incorporated companies (subsidiary organisations), which are themselves limited companies do not usually pay tax; the payment of taxes levied on the financial result of all the companies incorporated in the consolidated tax group is carried out entirely and exclusively by the parent company. The parent company in turn pays taxes on its own income and on the income of its subsidiaries, which may not exclusively result from activities related to the extraction of natural resources."
    p2: "For the purposes of the (consolidated group) payment report under German commercial law, the following differentiations are made at the level of the parent company:"
    item1: "If the consolidated tax group is mainly active in the extractive industry pursuant to § 341r No. 1 of the HGB, reporting can be carried out for the total amount of the taxes paid by the parent company. There is no obligation to allocate the tax payments to activities within or outside the scope of § 341r No. 1 of the HGB."
    item2: "If, on the other hand, the consolidated tax group is not mainly active in the extractive industry as set down in §341r No. 1 of the HGB, the tax payments made by the parent company may be allocated on a voluntary basis. Otherwise, details of the tax payments made by the parent company will be omitted."
    p3: "The results of the payment reconciliation substantiate the major practical importance of consolidated tax groups in the taxation of groups of companies. In various cases concerning the companies participating in the payment reconciliation, details of the taxes paid by the parent company are consequently omitted (see the figures on the results of the payment reconciliation"

However, lease payments may have to be made to government agencies in connection with the extraction of non-free-to-mine natural resources, particularly in the quarried natural resources sector, and this is indeed the case when government agencies (as owners) conclude contracts for the extraction of natural resources with extractive sector companies. Such contractual arrangements may include fixed payments or payments that depend on the quantity extracted, or a combination of both variants."
    p2_1: "The recipients of the lease payments are the government agencies that have concluded the contractual arrangements with the company (e.g. municipalities, forestry offices, as well as state property administration and moor management authorities). The content and the number of contracts are not centrally documented ("

In addition, the individual government agencies which have concluded lease contracts – unlike the individual tax offices in the case of corporation tax – cannot be centrally addressed via an organisational unit.

    p3: "Just which government agencies – and how many of them – receive lease payments cannot be foreseen. This information can only be provided by the participating companies themselves within the framework of the data collection process. "
    p4: "The MSG has therefore decided to record payments made to government agencies by the companies within the framework of the data collection process, but to exclude them from payment reconciliation. By way of example, and in keeping with the trade tax payments, the MSG originally intended to have the Independent Administrator reconcile the leasing payments made by one participating company as a representative example for all other participating companies. However, this exemplary reconciliation has not yet come to fruition."

A government agency to which less than €100,000 has been paid during the reporting period does not have to be included. "
    p2: "The MSG has decided to adopt these rules for the first D-EITI report. If payments made during reporting year 2016 amounted to less than €100,000 per government agency, the data collection templates require relevant proof of the existence of payments, but without mentioning any specific amounts."

    p4: "In the statistical classification of the economic sectors (WZ 2008), the ‘Mining and Quarrying’ segment encompasses the entire section B with the following sub-sectors: coal mining (WZ08-05); crude oil and natural gas extraction (WZ08-06); ore mining (WZ08-07); Quarried natural resources, other mining products (WZ08-08), and the performance of services for mining and for quarrying (WZ08-09). A detailed list of these sub-sectors can be found in the publication ‘Klassifikation der Wirtschaftszweige’ (Classification of Economic Activities) of the Federal Office of Statistics, pages 175 to 185. It should be noted that section B (‘Mining and Quarrying’) includes the sub-sector ‘Provision of Services for Mining and Quarrying’ (WZ08-09). This, however, does not include classical extraction activities."
